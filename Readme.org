The code in this repository builds a docker image that contains
the [[https://github.com/igrigorik/node-spdyproxy][Ilya Grigorik's spdy proxy]].

This image is available as bhyde/crate-of-node-spdyproxy on the
[[https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/bhyde/crate-of-node-spdyproxy/][docker hub]].

Since you don't trust me, you may feel more secure if you build your
own with the help of the rebuild-image script.  Of course you totally
trust Ilya, the nodejs team, and who ever build the docker node image.

The script launch-container is used to create a container based
on the image.  Reading that script you will notice that it gives
your container it's own personality by mounting into the container
the directory proxy-stuff.  There in we find:
+ The key and cert for your site.  Since your users will connect
  using https.
+ The script that starts the proxy.  That sets a user/password
  that all your users will use to gain access to the proxy.

Be careful - don't check your real key/cert into a
public repository by mistake.
